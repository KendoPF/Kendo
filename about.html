      This page was developed to give potential kendo students information that may be of help since the closure of the local Louth Kendo Club<br><br>
      I myself was one of the students at the Louth Dojo and since its closure I have been looking for a new dojo and trying to improve my skills.<br>
      My aim here is to save other students and potential students the work I had to do to to collect the information on this website.<br><br>
      If you have any further queries or suggestions for or about the webpage please use the enquiries form above.  <br><br>

      <legend>About me</legend>
      I am in my 50s and have studied martial arts and fencing in various forms since my teens. I have a number of years experience and I am still learning.<br>
      While I have a passion for Kendo and have spent some time compiling the information on this website, I am in no way affiliated with any offical Kendo Body or club.<br>
	  Thanks again for visiting the site.
